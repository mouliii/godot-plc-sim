# Sharp7 OFFICIAL

This is the **official** Sharp7 repository starting with release 1.1.1.

Previous releases are available in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/snap7/files/Sharp7/" target="_blank">SourceForge</a> repository.

The official site is still <a href="https://snap7.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.

### philosophy

Sharp7 is a **single-file library**, because it is aimed at industrial programmers, that is, those who need to equip their programs with S7 communication.

I have seen many revisions in pure Microsoft style: one file for each constant, this is not the goal of Sharp7.

Copy Sharp7.cs into your project folder, add Sharp7 in your project tree, write:

`using Sharp7;`

and you are ready to communicate with Siemens PLCs, without any more hallucinations.
